# Personal Affirmation Generator

This is a simple Python project that generates personalized affirmations focused on self-control, clarity, consistency, and personal growth.

I built this project as part of my Python learning journey and as a practical tool to support discipline, focus, and long-term goals. The affirmations are meant to feel grounded and relevant, not generic motivational quotes.

## Why this project exists

While learning Python, I wanted to build something that:
- Reinforces positive habits and mindset
- Has a real personal use case
- Grows with my coding skills over time

This project combines programming practice with personal development.

## What it does

- Stores a list of affirmations
- Randomly selects and displays an affirmation when run
- Can be expanded with more categories or custom affirmations

Depending on the version, it can be used as:
- A terminal-based affirmation generator
- A foundation for an audio or GUI-based version in the future

## How to run it

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Run the Python file from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
